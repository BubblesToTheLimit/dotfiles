Taking the video course for this at [[https://www.edx.org/course/linux-system-administration-essentials-linuxfoundationx-lfs201x][edx.org essential linux skills]] costs $500. I think i can learn
this by myself on the run.

Im not completely happy on how this file consists mostly out of headlines.

  - Configure sshd such that it allows remote root access
  - There is a command on how to reset the root password
  - There is a way on how to allow users to login as root not using the root password but their
    ssh keys which allows logging who did what
    - This is basically the way to go but requires some initial setup and the discipline and
      knowledge to pull through with it
* PENDING Use sudo to manage access to the root account
  The basic usage of sudo is clear.

  Care, with sudo I switch to roots environment variables and might "lose" some local ones. There
  is cool and detailed knowledge to have about this.
* DONE Write basic bash shell scripts

* DONE Install software packages
