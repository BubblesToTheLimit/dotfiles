#+Title:  Presentations Cheatsheet
#+Author: Felix Brilej

* Preparation
  - Start a clock in the beginning of the talk (see [[Timing]])
  - Be there 10 Minutes early
    - Check Internet Connection (optional)
    - Check readablity of slides (quick fix: change color theme?)
  - Start a video recording to enable proper feedback (optional)

* Timing
  - Figure out on which slide you should progress however far
    - Cut off a topic at a certain point once the bulletpoints are done

* Slides
  Style:
  - Up to 5 bullet points per slide at best

  Content:
  - Have in mind which topics would be "advanced" and which ones would be considered "basic", this
    gives you the ability to cut off topics after the basics are done when you run out of time

* The Introduction
  - Talk about the pursued outcome of the talk, should be up to three bullet points using easy
    language
    - Focus on this part before the talk, the simplicity of the pursued outcome also calms me down
      as the presentor

* Feedback
  - Have pen and paper ready to take feedback / critizism (optional)
