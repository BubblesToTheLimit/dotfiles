# dotfiles

This contains all the dotfiles I'd place under ~/ on a system I use frequently.
I try to keep my dotfiles lightweight so they run on alot of machines.

See how I have a seperate repository for my emacs dotfiles, just because I love it so much.
Also it is not lightweight. It is fat like big mama. Everybody loves big mama :)
